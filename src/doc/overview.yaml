why_air:
  title: "Why Air Matters"
  description: "Air is the living, breathing network that connects all agents in the ecosystem. It provides the real-time, distributed foundation that enables agents to communicate, coordinate, and collaborate without central control."
  
  benefits:
    - "No central point of failure - fully distributed architecture"
    - "Real-time updates - instant propagation across the network"
    - "Offline resilience - works without constant connectivity"
    - "Conflict-free - CRDT technology ensures consistency"
    - "Privacy-preserving - data stays within your network"
    - "Scalable - grows with your agent ecosystem"
